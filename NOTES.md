# Notes

This file is to keep track of changes made over time and to have reference points for the implementation. Very old
information has been removed. Specification details about the communication protocol between indexing server and light
clients can be found [here](https://github.com/setavenger/BIP0352-light-client-specification.git).

## Tweak Computation Performance

Results from Benchmarking. Running v2 is a clear win in terms of speed for all types of blocks (many txs and few txs).
Spinning up a go routine for every tweak seems very efficient. But can it be improved? Can push the performance even a
bit more?
Next I want to try to assign a number of tweaks to a goroutine before it spins up,
so that we don't have the overhead of a goroutine spinning up all the time.

We variations between different benchmarking calls,
as seen by v1 where the only one thread is used, and we still see some discrepancies.
Overall the pattern becomes clear. v4 reduces the overhead of goroutine spawning significantly but does not outperform
v2 in any real way.
v2 seems to be quite optimised at this point. I'm not quite sure what one could try to boost performance except of
course just utilizing more cores.
Using more cores clearly improves the performance (almost linearly in some cases).
Parallel processing could be used for extracting [spent UTXOs](./src/core/extractutxos.go) (L:31) as well.
This is not a priority at the moment as the processing time seems to be low.

It should be noted that these are benchmarking results when solely running the tweak computation function.
During initial syncing/indexing there are also a lot of parallel processes for the rpc calls.

The functions can be found [here](./src/core/tweak.go).
